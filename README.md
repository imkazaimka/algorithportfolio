# Sorting, Filtering, and Aggregation Program

This Python program allows users to process datasets by:
- Filtering data based on specified conditions (e.g., class, scores, nationality).
- Aggregating numeric data to calculate statistics such as mean, median, and quartiles.
- Sorting data using a Bubble Sort algorithm.

The program is user-friendly, featuring a menu-driven interface for ease of use. It validates inputs to ensure robustness and handles edge cases gracefully.

## Features
- **Filtering**: Users can filter datasets based on specific fields (e.g., name, class, scores) with conditions like "greater than."
- **Aggregation**: Calculates essential statistics, including count, min, max, mean, median, Q1, and Q3.
- **Sorting**: Sorts datasets by any specified field using a Bubble Sort algorithm.
- **Validation**: Handles invalid inputs, missing data, and other edge cases gracefully.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation
